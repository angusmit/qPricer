# ⚡ qPricer — Option Pricing in q/kdb+

A high-performance financial pricing engine written in `q` — purpose-built for fast, expressive modelling of derivatives.

> 🚧 **Work in Progress** — Bringing classic and exotic option pricing to kdb+/q with real-time analytics in mind.

## ✨ Planned Features

- 🔍 **Greeks**  
  Sensitivity measures — delta, gamma, vega, theta, rho — calculated in pure q

- 📈 **Jump Diffusion Models**  
  Incorporate discontinuities in asset paths (e.g. Merton, Kou models)

- 📊 **Asian Option Pricing**  
  Support for geometric and arithmetic averages (analytic + Monte Carlo)

- 🧠 **Implied Volatility Solver**  
  Invert Black-Scholes and other models to back out implied volatility
